# DogCoatCalc
This program was created in 2024 as part of my engineer's thesis in Bioinformatics at Wroc≈Çaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences. It aims to predict offspring color and pattern in dogs based only on parent traits, without the need to input genotype data.
## Installation instructions
In order to use DogCoatCalc, you need a Python interpreter. This tool was built using Python 3.9, which can be downloaded here: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
